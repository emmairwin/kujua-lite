          <h2>What is Kujua?</h2>
          <p>
          <span class="kujua">Kujua</span> is an SMS data collection and
          analytics software platform targeted at community health care
          workers in the developing world.  We help large health
          organizations to collect and analyze data sent from health care
          workers using ordinary mobile phones in remote and rural environments.

          <h2>How does it work?</h2>
          <p>
          <span class="kujua">Kujua</span> is compromised of the following
          components: <i>Muvuku</i>, <i>SMSSync</i> and Kujua Export.
          <i>Muvuku</i> is software that runs on a parallel SIM card and
          provides customized input forms to nearly any ordinary cell phone,
          using the native API of the phone.  It collects the data on the
          phone and then sends a specially formatted SMS message to an SMS
          Gateway.  SMSSync is used as the collection device which then
          passes the data to a web application listening on the same local
          network as the Gateway.  Kujua Export provides an interface to the
          SMS data, making it more useable for reporting and analytics.

          <h2>What is a CouchApp?</h2>
          <p>
          A <b>CouchApp</b> is a web application that runs inside of
          CouchDB.  It is part of a distributed architecture philosophy that
          allows for easy replication and sharing of applications and data.
          In the environments we deploy in rolling blackouts and intermittent
          connections are very common.  So we must keep the data as
          close/local to the people using it as possible.  CouchDB also
          provides a web server as well as a Javascript interpreter, so the
          only infrastructure requirement to run the web application is
          CouchDB.
