          <h2>What is Kujua?</h2>
          <p>
          <span class="kujua">Kujua</span> is an SMS data collection and
          analytics software platform targeted at community health care
          workers in the developing world.  We help large health
          organizations to collect and analyze data sent from health care
          workers using ordinary mobile phones in remote and rural environments.

          <h2>How does it work?</h2>
          <p>
          <span class="kujua">Kujua</span> is currently made up of the
          following components: <i>Muvuku</i>, <i>SMSSync</i> and <i>Kujua Export</i>.
          <i>Muvuku</i> is a framework for rapid design, compilation,
          and deployment of SIM Application Toolkit (STK) -based data
          collection tools. We built this tool to quickly deploy forms that can
          run on a parallel SIM card and used on nearly any ordinary cell
          phone, using the native API of the phone.  The forms collect data on
          the phone and then sends a specially formatted SMS message to an SMS
          Gateway.  SMSSync is used as the collection device which then passes
          the data to a web service (Kujua Export) listening on the same local
          network as the Gateway.  Kujua Export provides an interface to the
          SMS data, making it more useable for reporting and analytics.

          <h2>What is a CouchApp?</h2>
          <p>
          A <b>CouchApp</b> is a web application or service that runs inside of
          CouchDB.  It is part of a distributed architecture philosophy that
          allows for easy replication and sharing of applications and data over
          HTTP.  The environments we deploy in have rolling blackouts and
          intermittent connections.  So we must keep the data as close and
          local to the people using it as possible.  CouchDB also provides a
          web server as well as a Javascript interpreter, so the only
          infrastructure requirement to run the web application is CouchDB.
          Kujua Export is a CouchApp.
