          <h2>What is Kujua?</h2>
          <p>
          <span class="kujua">Kujua</span> is a SMS data collection and
          analytics software platform targeted at community health care
          workers in the developing world.  We help large health organizations
          collect and analyze data sent from health care workers using ordinary
          mobile phones in remote and rural environments.

          <h2>How does it work?</h2>
          <p>
          <span class="kujua">Kujua</span> is currently made up of the
          following components: <i>Muvuku</i>, <i>SMSSync</i> and <i>Kujua Export</i>.
          <i>Muvuku</i> is a framework for rapid design, compilation, and
          deployment of forms that run on nearly any ordinary cell phone, using
          the native API of the phone.  The forms collect data on the phone and
          then sends a specially formatted SMS message to a SMS Gateway.
          <i>SMSSync</i> is used as the collection device which then passes the
          data to a web service listening on the same local network as the
          Gateway.  <i>Kujua Export</i> consumes the SMS data and creates
          records that can be managed via a user interface, allowing you to
          monitor your incoming data, download it to a spreadsheet, and manage
          your related facility data.

          <h2>What is a CouchApp?</h2>
          <p>
          A <b>CouchApp</b> is a web application or service that runs inside of
          CouchDB.  It is part of a distributed architecture philosophy that
          allows for easy replication and sharing of applications and data over
          HTTP.  The environments we deploy in have rolling blackouts and
          intermittent connections to the internet.  So we must keep the data
          as close and local to the people using it as possible.  CouchDB also
          provides a web server as well as a Javascript interpreter, so the
          only infrastructure requirement to run the web application is
          CouchDB.  <i>Kujua Export</i> is a CouchApp.
