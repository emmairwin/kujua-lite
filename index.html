          <h2>What is Kujua?</h2>
          <p>
          <span class="kujua">Kujua</span> is an SMS data collection and
          analytics software platform targeted at community health care
          workers in the developing world.  We help large health
          organizations to collect and analyze data sent from health care
          workers using ordinary mobile phones in remote and rural environments.

          <h2>How does it work?</h2>
          <p>
          <span class="kujua">Kujua</span> is currently made up of the
          following components: <i>Muvuku</i>, <i>SMSSync</i> and <i>Kujua Export</i>.
          <i>Muvuku</i> is a framework for rapid design, compilation, and
          deployment of forms that run on nearly any ordinary cell phone, using
          the native API of the phone.  The forms collect data on the phone and
          then sends a specially formatted SMS message to a SMS Gateway.
          SMSSync is used as the collection device which then passes the data
          to a web service (Kujua Export) listening on the same local network
          as the Gateway.  Kujua Export provides a clean interface to your SMS
          Forms data, allows you to download the data to a spreadsheet format,
          and helps manage related health facility data.

          <h2>What is a CouchApp?</h2>
          <p>
          A <b>CouchApp</b> is a web application or service that runs inside of
          CouchDB.  It is part of a distributed architecture philosophy that
          allows for easy replication and sharing of applications and data over
          HTTP.  The environments we deploy in have rolling blackouts and
          intermittent connections to the internet.  So we must keep the data
          as close and local to the people using it as possible.  CouchDB also
          provides a web server as well as a Javascript interpreter, so the
          only infrastructure requirement to run the web application is
          CouchDB.  Kujua Export is a CouchApp.
