          <h2>What is Kujua?</h2>
          <p>
          <span class="kujua">Kujua</span> is an SMS data collection and analytics
            software platform focused on community health care workers in the
            developing world. We help large health organizations collect and
            analyze data sent from health care workers using ordinary mobile
            phones in remote and rural environments.

          <h2>How does it work?</h2>
          <p>
          <span class="kujua">Kujua</span> is currently made up of the
          following components: <i>Muvuku</i>, <i>SMSSync</i> and <i>Kujua
            Export</i>.  <i>Muvuku</i> is a framework for rapid design,
          compilation, and deployment of forms that run on nearly any ordinary
          cell phone, using the native API of the phone. The forms collect data
          on the phone and send messages to an SMS Gateway (<i>SMSSync</i>),
          and then to a web service on the local network.  <i>Kujua Export</i>
          creates records and provides a user interface to the SMS data.  It
          allowing you to monitor your incoming data, export it to a
          spreadsheet, and manage your related facility data.

          <h2>What is a CouchApp?</h2>
          <p>
          A <i>CouchApp</i> is a web application or service that runs inside of
          CouchDB.  <i>Kujua Export</i> is a CouchApp.  It is part of a
          distributed architecture philosophy that allows for easy replication
          and sharing of applications and data over HTTP, the lingua franca of
          the web. The environments we deploy in have rolling blackouts and
          intermittent connections to the internet. So we must keep the data as
          local to the people using it as possible. CouchDB also provides a web
          server as well as a Javascript interpreter, so the only
          infrastructure requirement to run the web application is CouchDB.
